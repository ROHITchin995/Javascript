 * Here we go through all the elements in an array and compare each element with the key. If we find a
match, we return the index of the element. In our case, the variable i keeps track of where we are in
the array, and if we find a match, we return the current value for i.
If the element doesn't exist in our list, the linear search function won't return any i value from the loop.
We just return -1 after the loop to show that the function didn't find the desired element.

we are looking for multiple occurrences of a given element.
