/**
 * Here we have a two dimensional array it could be array of characters or integers but usually there will be ones and
zeros
Where 0 is the valid path and -1 would be like the wall and here we use recursion to iterate over this array, here we
need to find out the starting point, usually the starting point will be off (0,0)
and ending at the end of the array. So you have to find the way by figuring out which path has 0 and then take the
path and if you get a like a wall or thereâ€™s nowhere else to go then you have to go back to where you started
