/**
 * Problem Statement
You have been given an array A of size N, which contains only O's and 1's. 
You have to make array A sorted in non-decreasing order. You can do the following operation as many 
times as you want
Choose some indices (At least one) i (1 i N-1) such that for all chosen i, A[i] = 1 and A[i+1] = 0. 
Swap A[i] and A[i+1],
Print the minimum number of operations you need to sort array A in non-decreasing order.
Constraints
1 t 103
1 N 105
â€¢O A[i] 1
Time Limit:- 1s for C++

Input Format
First-line contains a single integer t, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of elements in array A.
The second line of each test case contains N integers.
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*105

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line the minimum number of operations you need to sort array 
A in non-decreasing order.
